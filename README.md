# Zambia Mapping

This repository contains shapefiles, population data and an R Markdown document for creating maps of Zambia's administrative boundaries and health facilities.

## Setup

Run the provided setup script to install R, required packages and render the map document:

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

This script assumes an Ubuntu/Debian environment with `apt-get` available. It installs system dependencies, R packages, and finally renders `zambia_maps.Rmd` to produce an HTML output.
